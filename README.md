# WiFiReports
This repository is my final master's degree project for "Master de cibnerseguridad" (Maaster's degree in cybersecurity) for "Universidad de Sevilla".


In this project I have analyzed and developed 3 different things:

- Analyzed free Wi-Fi password software
- Developed a distributed cluster using HTCondor for performing brute-force attacks against Wi-Fi password hashes.
- Exploited all known vulnerabilities for WEP, WPA/WPA2 and multi-protocol vulnerabilities for obtaining WiFi passwords.
